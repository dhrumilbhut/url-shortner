# 🔗 URL Shortener

![CI](https://github.com/dhrumilbhut/url-shortner/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A production-grade URL shortening service built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, and **RabbitMQ** — deployed on Railway.

Click analytics are processed asynchronously via a dedicated RabbitMQ worker. Redirects are never slowed down by analytics writes. Redis is used in four distinct patterns: cache, atomic counter, sliding window rate limiter, and token store. Auth is a two-token JWT system with immediate revocation via a Redis blocklist.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
POST /shorten  →  JWT verify  →  Postgres (store URL)

GET  /r/:code  →  Redis cache
                    ├── HIT:  instant redirect (no DB query)
                    └── MISS: Postgres → cache → redirect
                ↓
            RabbitMQ (fire & forget — redirect never waits)
                ↓
            Worker process (separate service)
                ↓
            Redis INCR (atomic click counter)

GET /analytics/:code  →  Postgres metadata + Redis click count
```

## 🚀 Deployment

Deployed on **Railway** with 5 services communicating over Railway's private network:

| Service | How |
|---|---|
| API server | Built from Dockerfile |
| Click worker | Same image, different start command |
| PostgreSQL | Railway plugin |
| Redis | Railway plugin |
| RabbitMQ | Railway Docker service (`rabbitmq:3-alpine`) |

Services connect via `*.railway.internal` hostnames — no public ports exposed for infra, no credentials in transit. The worker and API share the same Docker image but run independently; the worker can crash and restart without affecting redirects.

CI runs on every push via **GitHub Actions** — spins up all three infra services as containers, boots the API, and hits `/health` to verify all connections before marking the build green.

## 🖥️ UI

A minimal frontend served at `/` — login/register, shorten URLs, copy, delete, and inline click stats.

### Login / Register

### Regular user

### Admin user

> Admins see a **👑 User Management** panel with live ban/unban controls. Banning a user immediately invalidates their refresh token — they cannot obtain new access tokens.

## 🔑 Auth Design

Two-token system built around a key tradeoff: **JWTs are stateless and cannot be revoked**. Keeping them short-lived (15 min) limits damage if stolen. Refresh tokens live in Redis and are deleted instantly on logout or ban.

| Token | Lifespan | Storage | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Access token (JWT) | 15 min | Client only | `Authorization: Bearer` on every request |
| Refresh token (UUID) | 7 days | Redis | Silently renew access token |

**Immediate revocation** is handled two ways:
- `POST /auth/invalidate` — blocklists the token's `jti` in Redis with TTL = remaining lifetime. Auto-expires, no cleanup needed.
- `POST /auth/admin/ban/:userId` — sets `banned:{userId}` in Redis (no TTL) + deletes their refresh token. Every subsequent request is rejected at the middleware level.

## ⚡ Redis Patterns

Four distinct patterns — each solves a different problem:

| Key | Pattern | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `url:{code}` | Cache (TTL 1h) | Redirects skip Postgres on cache hit |
| `clicks:{code}` | Atomic INCR | Safe under concurrent writes — no race conditions |
| `rate:{ip}` | Sorted set sliding window | Accurate per-IP limiting across a rolling 60s window |
| `refresh:{userId}` | String (TTL 7d) | Revocable session — deleted on logout or ban |
| `blocklist:{jti}` | String (TTL = remaining lifetime) | Immediate token invalidation, auto-cleanup |
| `banned:{userId}` | String (no TTL) | Permanent user block until manually lifted |

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD

Every push to `main` (except docs/screenshots) triggers a GitHub Actions workflow:

1. Spins up Postgres, Redis, and RabbitMQ as service containers
2. Installs dependencies and initializes the database schema from `init.sql`
3. Boots the API server
4. Polls `/health` until ready, then asserts all three services return `"ok"`

Pushes that only change `.md` files or `screenshots/` skip CI entirely.

## 🏃 Running Locally

### Option 1 — Docker (recommended)

Requires [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). No other installs needed — Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ, API, and worker all start together.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Tables are created automatically on first run. Open `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
docker compose down      # stop, keep data
docker compose down -v   # stop, delete data
```

### Option 2 — Local

Requires PostgreSQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ running locally.

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill in your values
npm install

# Terminal 1
npm run dev

# Terminal 2
npm run worker
```

Create the schema:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE shortener;
\c shortener
-- then run the contents of init.sql
```

> **Windows / WSL Redis:** `wsl sudo service redis-server start`

| GET | `/analytics/:shortCode` | — | Click stats |
| GET | `/health` | — | `{"postgres":"ok","redis":"ok","rabbitmq":"ok"}` |

> ⚠️ `totalClicks` only increments while the worker is running.
